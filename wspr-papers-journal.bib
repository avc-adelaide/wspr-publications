	abstract = { Human walking gait is a personal story written by the body, a tool for understanding biological identity in healthcare and security. Gait analysis methods traditionally diverged between these domains but are now merging their complementary strengths to unlock new possibilities. Using large ground reaction force (GRF) datasets for gait recognition is a way to uncover subtle variations that define individual gait patterns. Previously, this was done by developing and evaluating machine learning models on the same individuals or the same dataset, potentially biasing findings towards population samples or walking conditions. This study introduces a new method for analysing gait variation across individuals, groups and datasets to explore how demographics and walking conditions shape individual gait patterns. Machine learning models were implemented using numerous configurations of four large walking GRF datasets from different countries (740 individuals, 7400 samples) and analysed using explainable artificial intelligence tools. Recognition accuracy ranged from 52 to 100\%, with factors like footwear, walking speed and body mass playing interactive roles in defining gait. Models developed with individuals walking in personal footwear at multiple speeds effectively recognized novel individuals across populations and conditions (89--99\% accuracy). Integrating force platform hardware and gait recognition software could be invaluable for reading the complex stories of human walking. },

	abstract = {Accurate measurement of small forces on large objects under experimental laboratory conditions is challenging due to the limited sensitivity of available instruments and adaptable methods. For example, in wind tunnel testing for aerodynamic performance, the generation of very small lift or drag forces on the test object often proves difficult to quantify. Recent advancements in maglev technology have led to its application in wind tunnel studies, where it is used to mitigate the interference on measurements caused by support systems. However, the accuracy of measurements may be compromised due to systemic errors affecting the performance of force sensors in the wind tunnel, such as mechanical vibrations, misalignments, and contact deformations. To address these issues in the measurement of small forces during wind tunnel experiments, this paper proposes a contactless method for measuring small horizontal forces based on current variation in the levitation coil, which can be generally applied in maglev systems. To investigate and understand the changes in the coil with applied control system, a coil-to-permanent-magnet maglev model with applied horizontal force has been developed and studied. Both software simulations and experimental validations are used to ensure the validity of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {The Maxwell Stress Tensor is a computationally efficient method for calculating the force and torque between two arbitrary collections of rigidly-connected permanent magnets, coils, and/or iron (soft magnet) segments, when using exact analytic magnetic field solutions. However, use of the tensor exacerbates numerical errors present in the closed-surface free space mesh of a region, whether that be from an approximate field solution such as a finite sum, or discretisation errors that create a numeric non-zero divergence. Using a specialised identity of the divergence theorem, this article derives a generalised Maxwell Stress Tensor, which is interchangeable with the standard form and significantly reduces or removes numerical error sources from the meshing. The application focus of this work is modelling of non-periodic permanent magnet machines without geometrical assumptions through superposition of analytic magnetic field solutions (B and H) from a large number of elements. The influence of relative permeability can be included in these elements through varying the volumetric magnetic charge or current densities. Case studies with analytic or finite element force solutions are used to verify the result and compare the accuracy and computational efficiency with traditional semi-analytic methods. The proposed tensor enables parametric studies with accuracy not previously possible using an elemental modelling method, and can be applied to existing multiphysics models.},

	abstract = {{Nowadays 3D printing technology has allowed humanities scholars and cultural materials conservators to create replicas of indigenous musical instruments, with which they can perform various studies. However, the size of the 3D printed objects are limited by the size and the range of movements of the 3D printer. Hence, large musical instruments have to be fabricated in parts and then carefully assembled prior to playing. Here we investigate the yi?aki, a large pipe-like indigenous Australian wind instrument that is played by vibrating the lips while breathing circularly on the mouthpiece. Traditionally, a yi?aki is made from the trunk of hardwoods hollowed by termites. We scanned the internal and external shape of a traditionally-made yi?aki, built a digital model from the scanning data, printed the model in several parts, and assembled the parts into a replica yi?aki. This replica was printed using sintered nylon and assembled using a two-part epoxy. Both the original and the replica yi?akis have been played by musicians and the resulting sound data have been analysed. Our results show that, even though the replica generates yi?aki-like sounds as expected, there are subtle differences between the sound of the original and the replica.}},

	abstract = {Abstract This study provides analytic solutions for the magnetic field of coils and magnets that have a non-axisymmetric cylindrical geometry with a rectangular cross-section. New analytic solutions are provided for radially magnetized permanent magnet arcs, thin coil disc sectors, and thick coil sectors. If components of the 3D field are not representable in closed-form or as canonical Legendre elliptic integrals, the exact solution is given in terms of a series of regularized beta functions. The limit and hence spatial convergence is found to these series, giving a well-defined and fast solving algorithm for computation. The equations can be readily applied to find the magnetostatic field in linear or non-linear systems that contain a large set of elements. Example applications are provided to demonstrate how the field can be used to calculate forces and benchmark computational efficiency of the equations. A thorough review of the preceding literature and background theory is provided before a detailed methodology obtaining the analytic solutions contained in this compendium, and further related geometries in cylindrical or spherical coordinates. This is the first study to comprehensively solve the field equations for this collection of electromagnetic geometries.},

	abstract = {Understanding of human neck stiffness and range of motion (ROM) with minimal neck muscle activation (``passive'') is important for clinical and bioengineering applications. The aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate the reliability of methods for assessing passive-lying stiffness and ROM, in six head-neck rotation directions. Six participants completed two assessment sessions. To perform passive-lying tests, the participant's head and torso were strapped to a bending (flexion, extension, lateral bending) or a rotation (axial rotation) apparatus, and clinical bed, respectively. The head and neck were manually rotated by the researcher to the participant's maximum ROM, to assess passive-lying stiffness. Participant-initiated (``active'') head ROM was also assessed in the apparatus, and seated. Various measures of apparatus functionality were assessed. ROM was similar for all assessment configurations in each motion direction except flexion. In each direction, passive stiffness generally increased throughout neck rotation. Within-session reliability for stiffness (ICC > 0.656) and ROM (ICC > 0.872) was acceptable, but between-session reliability was low for some motion directions, probably due to intrinsic participant factors, participant-apparatus interaction, and the relatively low participant number. Moment-angle corridors from both assessment sessions were similar, suggesting that with greater sample size, these methods may be suitable for estimating population-level corridors.},

	abstract = {Well characterised mechanical response of the normal head-neck complex during passive motion is important to inform and verify physical surrogate and computational models of the human neck, and to inform normal baseline for clinical assessments. For 10 male and 10 female participants aged 20 to 29, the range of motion (ROM) of the neck about three anatomical axes was evaluated in active-seated, passive-lying and active-lying configurations, and the neck stiffness was evaluated in passive-lying. Electromyographic signals from the agonist muscles, normalised to maximum voluntary contractions, were used to provide feedback during passive motions. The effect of sex and configuration on ROM, and the effect of sex on linear estimates of stiffness in three regions of the moment--angle curve, were assessed with linear mixed models and generalised linear models. There were no differences in male and female ROM across all motion directions and configurations. Flexion and axial rotation ROM were configuration dependent. The passive-lying moment--angle relationship was typically non-linear, with higher stiffness (slope) closer to end of ROM. When normalising the passive moment--angle curve to active lying ROM, passive stiffness was sex dependent only for lateral bending region 1 and 2. Aggregate moment--angle corridors were similar for males and females in flexion and extension, but exhibited a higher degree of variation in applied moment for males in lateral bending and axial rotation. These data provide the passive response of the neck to low rate bending and axial rotation angular displacement, which may be useful for computational and surrogate modelling of the human neck.},

	abstract = {{Window coverings have traditionally been used for design and light control only. However, they also present a great opportunity for a complete acoustic treatment. This is for a number of reasons: (1) They are installed over glazing which represents the typical weak point through which sound enters the space; (2) they have a large surface area for absorption; and (3) they are a natural fit in most modern spaces allowing architects, designers, and clients freedom in their design unconstrained by acoustics. By combining mass loaded vinyl to target sound transmission and absorptive surface linings to provide sound absorption, it is possible to significantly improve acoustic comfort with installation of acoustic curtains. This paper presents the results of extensive laboratory tests on such acoustic curtains, where the diffuse field sound reduction index and sound absorption coefficients were measured for four glazing conditions (open window, 4 mm glass, 6.38 mm glass, and 10.38 mm glass) with 15 different curtain configurations, totalling 76 tests. The results demonstrate significant sound level reductions with the addition of the curtains, with a weighted noise reduction index improvement as high as 13 dB, and a noise reduction coefficient of 0.65 for an additional 2 kg per square metre.}},

	abstract = {<jats:p>The dynamic response of a submerged CETO shaped quasi-point absorbing wave energy converter coupled to a bistable power take off is presented in this study. Whilst the impact of bistability has been shown in a limited number of situations to improve the amount of power generated, many models have been restricted to a single degree of freedom and often ignore drag effects. To overcome these model limitations, a submerged single tether point absorber with a bistable power take off was modelled using both 1 and 3 degrees of freedom. The device was subjected to regular waves and included a simple model of viscous drag. The bistable mechanism was provided by a magnetic dipole model quantified by a dimensionless parameter applicable to any bistable system. The performance of the device was is assessed by the theoretical power generated. Over each model, the previously observed benefit of bistability was not consistently obtained. Simulations of regular waves demonstrated an increase in generated power for suboptimal conditions for some frequencies, while a reduction in generated power was observed in optimal conditions. The performance increase showed strong correlation to the phase relationship between the motion and exciting forces as a result of bistability.</jats:p>},

	abstract = {Walking gait data acquired with force platforms may be used for person re-identification (re-ID) in various authentication, surveillance, and forensics applications. Current force platformbased re-ID systems classify a fixed set of identities (IDs), which presents a problem when IDs are added or removed from the database. We formulated force platform-based re-ID as a deep metric learning (DML) task, whereby a deep neural network learns a feature representation that can be compared between inputs using a distance metric. The force platform dataset used in this study is one of the largest and the most comprehensive of its kind, containing 193 IDs with significant variations in clothing, footwear, walking speed, and time between trials. Several DML model architectures were evaluated in a challenging setting where none of the IDs were seen during training (i.e., zero-shot re-ID) and there was only one prior sample per ID to compare with each query sample. The best architecture was 85\% accurate in this setting, though an analysis of changes in walking speed and footwear between measurement instances revealed that accuracy was 28\% higher on same-speed, same-footwear comparisons, compared to cross-speed, cross-footwear comparisons. These results demonstrate the potential of DML algorithms for zero-shot re-ID using force platform data, and highlight challenging cases.},

	abstract = {Prediction of propulsion kinematics and performance in wheelchair sports has the potential to improve capabilities of individual wheelchair prescription while minimizing testing requirements. While propulsion predictions have been developed for daily propulsion, these have not been extended for maximal effort in wheelchair sports. A two step-approach to predicting the effects of changing set-up in wheelchair rugby was developed, consisting of: (One) predicting propulsion kinematics during a 5 m sprint by adapting an existing linkage model; and (Two) applying partial least-squares regression to wheelchair set-up, propulsion kinematics, and performance. Eight elite wheelchair rugby players completed 5 m sprints in nine wheelchair set-ups while varying seat height, seat depth, seat angle, and tire pressure. Propulsion kinematics (contact and release angles) and performance (sprint time) were measured during each sprint and used for training and assessment for both models. Results were assessed through comparison of predicted and experimental propulsion kinematics (degree differences) for Step One and performance times (seconds differences) for Step Two. Kinematic measures, in particular contact angles, were identified with mean prediction errors less than 5 degrees for 43 of 48 predictions. Performance predictions were found to reflect on-court trends for some players, while others showed weaker prediction accuracy. More detailed modeling approaches that can account for individual athlete activity limitations would likely result in improved accuracy in propulsion and performance predictions across a range of wheelchair sports. Although this would come at an increased cost, developments would provide opportunities for more suitable set-ups earlier in an athlete's career, increasing performance and reducing injury risk.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE:To evaluate the effect of the braced arm-to-thigh technique (BATT) (versus self-selected techniques) on three-dimensional trunk kinematics and spinal loads for three common activities of daily living (ADLs) simulated in the laboratory: weeding (gardening), reaching for an object in a low cupboard, and car egress using the two-legs out technique. METHODS:Ten young healthy males performed each task using a self-selected technique, and then using the BATT. The pulling action of weeding was simulated using a magnet placed on a steel plate. Cupboard and car egress tasks were simulated using custom apparatus representing the dimensions of a kitchen cabinet and a medium-sized Australian car, respectively. Three-dimensional trunk kinematics and L4/L5 spinal loads were estimated using the Lifting Full-Body OpenSim model and compared between techniques. Paired t-tests were used to compare peak values between methods (self-selected vs BATT). RESULTS:The BATT significantly reduced peak extension moments (13-51\%), and both compression (27-45\%) and shear forces (31-62\%) at L4/L5, compared to self-selected techniques for all three tasks (p < 0.05). Lateral bending angles increased with the BATT for weeding and cupboard tasks, but these changes were expected as the BATT inherently introduces asymmetric trunk motion. CONCLUSION:The BATT substantially reduced L4/L5 extension moments, and L4/L5 compression and shear forces, compared to self-selected methods, for three ADLs, in a small cohort of ten young healthy males without prior history of back pain. These study findings can be used to inform safe procedures for these three ADLs, as the results are considered representative of a mature population.},

	abstract = {This study compares the response of a submerged CETO-shaped point absorber wave energy converter using linear, partially-nonlinear, pseudo-nonlinear, and fully-nonlinear methods to model hydrodynamic effects. Linear potential flow models calculate hydrodynamic parameters to represent the fluid-structure interaction; typical dynamic models apply these parameters without pose-dependence. The partially-nonlinear method evaluates excitation forces at different poses to introduce a pose-dependent excitation force; in addition to the excitation force, the pseudo-nonlinear method calculates hydrodynamic coefficients using linear potential flow methods and includes pose-dependence through interpolating pre-calculated parameters to represent the radiation force. The fully-nonlinear CFD model is a numerical wave tank validated against published data. The applicability of linear-based methods has been explored by comparing the motion, force, and power of the system under various operating conditions against the fully-nonlinear results. It was expected that for low amplitude waves results tend towards the linear results; however, for both low amplitude waves and increased submergence depth, linear methods provided poor representations of the nonlinear CFD results. Geometric nonlinearities were insufficient to capture all the nonlinear behaviour. A frequency-dependent nonlinearity was identified in the water above the buoy resonating. For such submerged point absorbers, linear methods do not adequately represent the influential nonlinear effects.},

	abstract = {Despite the common use of one-handed lifting techniques for activities of daily living, these techniques have received little attention in the biomechanics literature. The braced arm-to-thigh technique (BATT) is a one-handed lifting method in which the dominant hand picks up objects, while the free hand braces the trunk on the ipsilateral thigh. The aim of this study was to compare the BATT to two-handed or unsupported one-handed lifting techniques with loads of 2 and 10 kg, by evaluating trunk motion and spine loading at L4/L5. Twenty healthy participants (30--70 years old) matched in age and sex to 18 participants with low back pain were recruited to the study. A three-axis load cell secured to the distal anterior thigh measured the bracing forces applied by the hand. The OpenSim Lifting Full-Body model was used to estimate trunk kinematics and spinal loading at L4/L5. Linear mixed-effects models were developed to compare trunk angles and L4/L5 moments and forces between lifting techniques. Trunk flexion angles were significantly reduced for the BATT lift compared to one-handed and two-handed stoop lifts (9--20\%). However, the BATT also increased asymmetric trunk kinematics and moments at L4/L5. The BATT produced significantly lower moments (28--38\%), and compressive (25--32\%) and antero-posterior shear (25--45\%) forces at L4/L5, compared to unsupported lifting techniques. Bracing the hand on the thigh to support the trunk can substantially reduce low back loading during lifting tasks of 2 to 10 kg.},

	abstract = { ABSTRACTPrescription of wheelchair rugby chairs is difficult due to the range of athlete impairment types and severities in the sport, difficulty in adjusting wheelchair settings, and assessing on-court performance. Currently, elite players rely on experiential knowledge (personal, coaches, and support staff) to select an appropriate set-up. Technological advancements, such as with inertial measurement units and processing algorithms, and representative testing approaches, has improved the potential for assessing set-ups at an individual level. An orthogonal design approach was implemented using an adjustable wheelchair to investigate the effect of seat height, seat depth, seat angle, and tyre pressure on performance, mobility, and propulsion kinematics. Six elite wheelchair rugby players completed testing in nine individually tailored wheelchair set-ups while monitoring both quantitative and qualitative measures of performance. From this testing, a recommended set-up was compared with the current set-up for each individual. A single case-study approach shows how the assessment method identifies parameter settings that can potentially improve performance. Three of six players reported a blind preference for the recommended set-up over the current set-up, whilst remaining players often displayed similar performance between their current and recommended set-ups. This approach can improve upon the current prescription process for rugby wheelchairs. },

	abstract = { ABSTRACTDue to the detrimental influence of unnecessary mass on performance, racing wheelchair instrumentation used in both competition assessment and research is currently limited. Attaining key kinetic parameters of propulsion can enhance technique and provide athletes with a competitive advantage. This research examined the plausibility of inertial measurement units (IMUs) to estimate propulsion forces, during a simulated wheelchair race start and training. Start propulsion data calculated from an IMU system was compared to reference force plate data; steady state motion data was compared with existing literature. Some agreement in kinetic parameters between IMU data was observed under steady state motion, with data from athletes following a linear force--velocity relationship. In this context, it is important to identify that this cannot be directly compared to the existing literature due to the different methods of force measurement and the lack of data for similar force measurements using IMUs. IMUs were ineffective when used with wheelchairs having spoked wheels. Performance was best for measurements in the direction of motion. Although exact agreement was not observed, the IMU can provide an effective tool in the in-field assessment of propulsion kinetics. },

	abstract = {{The anthropometries of elite wheelchair racing athletes differ from the generic, able-bodied anthropometries commonly used in computational biomechanical simulations. The impact of using able-bodied parameters on the accuracy of simulations involving wheelchair racing is currently unknown. In this study, athlete-specific mass segment inertial parameters of the head and neck, torso, upper arm, forearm, hand, thigh, shank, and feet for five elite wheelchair athletes were calculated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. These were compared against commonly used anthropometrics parameters of data presented in the literature. A computational biomechanical simulation of wheelchair propulsion using the upper extremity dynamic model in opensim assessed the sensitivity of athlete-specific mass parameters using Kruskal--Wallis analysis and Spearman correlations. Substantial between-athlete body mass distribution variances (thigh mass between 7.8\% and 22.4\% total body mass) and between-limb asymmetries (<62.4\% segment mass; 3.1 kg) were observed. Compared to nonathletic able-bodied anthropometric data, wheelchair racing athletes demonstrated greater mass in the upper extremities (up to 3.8\% total body mass) and less in the lower extremities (up to 9.8\% total body mass). Computational simulations were sensitive to individual body mass distribution, with joint torques increasing by up to 31.5\% when the scaling of segment masses (measured or generic) differed by up to 2.3\% total body mass. These data suggest that nonathletic, able-bodied mass segment inertial parameters are inappropriate for analyzing elite wheelchair racing motion.}},

	abstract = {This article outlines an algorithm which analytically calculates the magnetic field produced by a general polyhedral permanent magnet with any number of faces and arbitrary face orientations, then uses the algorithm to semi-analytically calculate the force and torque on a second general polyhedral magnet. The algorithm is validated against both the literature and finite element simulations using cuboids and dodecahedra. It is then used to model a basic two-magnet repulsive system, where it is shown that frustum magnets can produce a larger force per unit volume than cuboidal magnets. The shape of the frustums is optimized to maximize the force between them at a given separation distance, showing a considerable increase in force when compared with cuboidal magnets with the same volume. This article shows that there is scope to improve the performance of magnetic systems by using novel magnet shapes and presents an algorithm which can be used for this optimization process.},
