# WSPR Publications

This repository is the source of truth for my publication record.
I find it's so hard to keep these up-to-date and in sync across different platforms!
A work-in-progress to figure out how to maintain everything smoothly.

This repository creates a [browseable record](https://avc-adelaide.github.io/wspr-publications/) of the publications here for your viewing pleasure.
